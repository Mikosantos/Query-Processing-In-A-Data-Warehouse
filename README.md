# Query Processing In A Data Warehouse

## **Project Overview**

This project is a requisite machine course output for the **Advanced Database Systems** course. It applies the following concepts:
- **Data Warehouse**
- **ETL Pipeline and Data Wrangling**
- **OLAP Operations and Application**
- **Query Processing and Optimization**

---

### **Project Objectives**
The aim was to: 
1. **Data Warehouse Design**:  
   Design a data warehouse using the **Steam Games dataset** with a **snowflake schema**.

2. **ETL Pipeline Setup**:  
   Use **AI Studio (RapidMiner)** to set up an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline for loading data from various sources into the warehouse. This includes data wrangling tasks such as:
   - Cleaning
   - Splitting
   - Merging
   - Aggregating
   - Transforming as necessary

3. **OLAP Dashboard Application**:
   Develop an OLAP dashboard in **Tableau** to display analytical reports using data from the warehouse. The application demonstrates OLAP operations such as:
   - **Roll-up**
   - **Drill-down**
   - **Slice**
   - **Dice**

   #### **Queries:**
   - **Total number of games released each month in year X** with their average playtime, and positive/negative review counts.
   - **Games with a Metacritic score greater than X in the Y genre**, and with estimated owners greater than Z.
   - **Developers with Game/s of Genre X** that have at least Y positive reviews.
   - **Top 100 Games in X genre** based on popularity.
     
5. **Query Processing and Optimization**:  
   Apply query processing and optimization strategies to evaluate query performance in terms of speed and efficiency.
